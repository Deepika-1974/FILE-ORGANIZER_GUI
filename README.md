File Organizer
Description
The File Organizer is a Python-based desktop application built with the tkinter library that helps users organize their files by grouping them into directories based on their file extensions. The application also provides an option to delete these newly created directories after file organization, making it useful for cleanup or temporary arrangements.

Features
Automatic file organization: Moves files into folders named after their file extensions (e.g., .txt files into a "txt" folder).
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application uses a simple and easy-to-use interface for selecting the base directory and organizing files.
Confirmation before deletion: The user is prompted before deleting any created directories, with an option to skip deletion.
Error Handling: The program ensures proper error handling and informative messages during the process.
